[00:21.33] (Every now and then) Every now and then I fall
[00:27.71] Every now and then I lose control
[00:33.11] But in your eyes I see your thoughts surrounding me
[00:37.58] And I've a little bit of thought for you
[00:57.58] 
[00:44.00] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[00:49.65] Every time I stare into your eyes
[00:54.95] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[01:00.65] Every time I stare into your eyes
[01:17.15] 
[01:22.25] Every time I stare into your eyes
[01:38.75] 
[01:44.08] Every time I stare into your eyes
[02:00.58] 
[02:00.22] With your thrills, I find
[02:02.92] It's not hard to be left behind
[02:05.83] So I'll run, and you'll hide
[02:08.58] We know better than to stay outside
[02:11.03] You're cold and your awake
[02:14.00] You said I should have never of stayed
[02:16.62] But there's no better place for me
[02:33.62] 
[02:22.13] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[02:27.88] Every time I stare into your eyes
[02:32.98] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[02:38.75] Every time I stare into your eyes
[02:55.25] 
[03:03.19] Every time I stare into your eyes
[03:25.13] Every time I stare into your eyes
[03:41.63] 
[03:30.37] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[03:36.06] Every time I stare into your eyes
[03:41.35] 'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
[03:46.83] Every time I stare into your eyes
